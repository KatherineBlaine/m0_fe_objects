# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

This section made a lot of sense to me actually. It took a minute to get comfortable, but I got it pretty quickly. At first when the instructions were asking me to create an object variable, I overcomplicated things for myself and tried to create an array within an object for the "students' birthdays" example, because I wanted the variable to hold multiple different students names and information, but wasn't able to get it to work. By the time I reached the end of the objects assignment, though I wasn't successful creating the array within the object earlier, the challenge section made much more sense to me.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I definitely need to work on keeping my notes organized. I find myself sometimes writing them by hand and sometimes typing them up and they are in all differenct places. My goal is to go through and organize my notes after mod0 so I have them to look back on if needed as I start mod 1, and figure out some more strategies to take organized notes for when I start.

I find myself taking the best notes during lessons, but want to be able to incorporate the information I come across in my individual/pairing work time because those are some of the most valuable findings! When I'm working through an assignment and come across something noteworthy I just jot it down somewhere random which is not very helpful.

I think one thing I can do to help this is before I start each assignment, open a doc that is dedicated solely to that assignment so I remember to take notes and can easially access them later on.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I definitely try to solve it first, because sometimes when I google things I see a bunch of really complex code that overwhelmes me. I have gotten much better at specific google searches, but I definitely need to work on my googling skills. I also think its helpful for my learning to try a few things before I resort to google because I retain the information much better when I am actively trying to solve a problem.
